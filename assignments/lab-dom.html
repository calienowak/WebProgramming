<title>COMP 20: Web Programming - Lab: Document Object Model and Events</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>COMP 20: Web Programming</h1>
<h2>Lab: <span class="stress">Closed Captioning</span></h2>

<h2>Lab Objectives</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Practice writing JavaScript.</li>
	<li>Practice using the Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
	<li>Practice with using JavaScript objects.</li>
	<li>Understand event handling and using first-class function.</li>
	<li>Recognize the power of HTML5 (in this case, audio manipulation).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>HTML5 introduces built-in media support via the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements, offering the ability to easily embed and manipulate media on web pages (Mozilla.org).  In this lab, you will create a web page that annotates a video with text and perhaps other media.</p>

<h2>The Video</h2>
<p>The video that you will annotate is a classic and humorous scene from a classic movie:</p>

<video src="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/classic.mp4" id="classic_video" controls>
</video>
<p>You are free to use the following to access the video on your page and there is no need to make a copy of the video onto your computer:</p>
<pre>
&lt;video src="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/classic.mp4" id="classic_video" controls&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</pre>

<h2>The Quotes to the Scene in the Video</h2>
<pre>
Igor: DR. FRANKENSTEIN?!?!?
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: Frokensteen.
Igor: You're putting me on.
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: No, it pronounced, "Frokensteen".
Igor: Do you also say Froaderick?
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: No . . . "Frederick."
Igor: Well, why isn't it 'Froaderick Frokensteen'?
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: It isn't, it's "Frederick Frokensteen"
Igor: I see.
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: You must be Igor. [He pronounces it ee-gor.]
Igor: No, it's pronounced "eye-gor."
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: But they told me it was "ee-gor"...
Igor: Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: Uh, you were sent here by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Igor: Yes. My grandfather used to work for your grandfather.
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: How nice.
Igor: Of course the rates have gone up.
Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: Of course, of course, I'm sure we'll get along splendidly. Oh, I uh, you know I don't mean to embarrass you, but I'm rather a brilliant surgeon. Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
Igor: What hump?
</pre>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Once again, I am going to give you the HTML so you do not have to write it!  Copy and paste the following HTML below as your <code>index.html</code>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Classic Movie&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1 id="title"&gt;Classic Movie&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;video src="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20/classic.mp4" id="classic_video" controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;div id="movie_quotes"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
	// Complete this section and create a CSS file named style.css
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;	
</pre>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Using JavaScript, annotate the video with the lines in the movie inside the <code>&lt;div id="movie_quotes"&gt;</code>.  You must annotate the video line-by-line corresponding to the respective characters.  Finally, you must provide some styling for the page via <code>style.css</code>.</p>

<h2>The <code>README</code> File</h2>
<p>Each assignment and lab shall include a <code>README</code> file that describes the work. This description must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.</li>
<li>Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.</li>
<li>Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.</li>
<li>Be written in either text format (<code>README.txt</code>) or in Markdown (<code>README.md</code>).  Markdown is preferred.  No other formats will be accepted.  Please use all capital letters for <code>README</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This <code>README</code> file must be directly in the folder of the lab or assignment.</p>

<h2>Important</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You are not allowed to use jQuery for this lab.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting Your Lab</h2>
<p>Push all your files to a folder named <code>movie_annotation</code> inside of the private GitHub repo I created for you.  Say that your private repository is named <code>comp20-mchow</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>comp20-mchow/movie_annotation</code>.</p>
<pre>
# Inside your private GitHub repo folder (e.g., <code>comp20-mchow</code>)
git add .
git commit -m "<span class="stress">Some good commit message here</span>"
git push
</pre>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>This lab is worth 5 points.</p>
<ul>
	<li>(1.5 point) The basics (e.g., folder name in private GitHub repository, file names, repo name, README file, one CSS file)</li>
	<li>(3.5 points) The <code>index.html</code> page following all the instructions above</li>
	<li>(-5 points) You used jQuery</li>
	<li>(-3.5 points) Errors and outputs (e.g., from <code>console.log statements</code>) exist in JavaScript console</li>
</ul>
